    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It helps us evaluate how efficient an algorithm is, especially when dealing with large inputs. A good algorithm should have a time complexity that grows slowly as the input size increases. For example, algorithms with a time complexity of <b>O(log n)</b> or <b>O(n)</b> are generally more efficient than those with a time complexity of <b>O(nÂ²)</b> when handling larger datasets.

        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs in relation to the size of its input. It is important to consider when working with large datasets or systems with limited memory. The space complexity of an algorithm is typically expressed in Big O notation, such as <b>O(n)</b>, which means the space required grows linearly with the size of the input. A well-designed algorithm should aim to minimize both time complexity and space complexity to achieve optimal performance.
